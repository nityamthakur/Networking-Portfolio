This Campus Network Portfolio involves the design and configuration of a comprehensive campus network that includes core, distribution, and access layers with the Cisco iOS command line. In this project, I implement various protocols and technologies to ensure network segmentation, redundancy, security, and efficient traffic management. Key protocols and technologies include virtual local area networks (VLANs), trunking, spanning tree protocol (STP), EtherChannel, first hop redundancy protocols (FHRP), layer 3 switching, switch virtual interfaces (SVIs), DHCP relay, DHCP snooping, dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), and port security.
